    <h3><RandomTextReveal onHover={true} text="About" /></h3>
    <p>As someone with a deep passion for technology but a degree in a different field, I began a journey of self-learning in IT after my career was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I now work as an IT Business Analyst at a bank headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, where I can hone and expand my technology skills within a professional setting. Outside of my primary role, I dedicate my time to exploring vulnerabilities and delving into cybersecurity as an indie hacker, uncovering system weaknesses during my off-hours.</p>
